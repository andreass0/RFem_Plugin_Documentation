# Setting up a problem

A short overview of the representation of the data in the data model will be given in the beginning. After that the
tutorial focuses on modelling with the implemented user interface of the plugin. 

## Structural analysis component

In {numref}`struct_comp` a simplified depiction of the structural analysis component is given. This component is used in
the SIMULTAN datamodel to store the information needed to export data with the RFEM Plugin to enable structural analysis
simulations in RFEM 6.

A more in depth look into the SIMULTAN representation of the structural analysis data is given in the
chapter [SIMULTAN Datastructure to incorporate the RFEM Data model](SIMULTAN_Datastructure_to_incorporate_the_RFem_Data_model.md)
.

```{warning}
Although this data structure can be implemented manually, it is strongly recommended to use the user interface that
comes with the plugin for modelling. Manuel modelling is always prone to errors and could result in very time
consuming efforts when trying to fix those.
```

## Geometrical modelling

The geometry is created in the Geometry Editor of the SIMULTAN Editor. Please consult
the [SIMULTAN Editor User Guide](https://github.com/bph-tuwien/SIMULTAN.Documentation/wiki)
for further information on how to use this Geometry Editor.

### Modelling guidelines

In {numref}`simultan_geometry` it can be seen that the plugin uses a reference geometry (white) as well as a geometry
for the structural analysis (red). The reference geometry, representing the outer building envelope, can for example be
an architectural model or the model used for the building physics simulations.

```

```{tip}
The structural model (red) can be easily created by copying the surfaces of the reference geometry to the middle axis 
of the structural building components.
```

For the simulation the structural geometry is exported to RFEM, therefore all of information exclusively used for
structural analysis will be linked to this geometry.

## User Interface

The RFEM-Plugin comes with a user interface {numref}`ui_plugin` to help with the creation of the needed data structure
for the plugin. The user interface itself is closely built around the graphical interfaces of RFEM 6. With this we hope
to provide a familiar experience to all the RFEM users when using this plugin.

## Connecting components with the geometry

The before created components are a representation of the information needed for the structural analysis. Connect the
components to the geometry as needed. Please consult
the [SIMULTAN Editor User Guide](https://github.com/bph-tuwien/SIMULTAN.Documentation/wiki)
for general information on how to link components and geometrical information.

An outline of the most important links and how to create them will be given here.

### Surfaces

Information for surfaces are autogenerated via the already existing reference geometry since this data is not exclusive
to structural analysis.

### Members

Geometrical lines connected to physical properties for structural analysis, e.g. beams or columns, are called members in
RFEM. To add a `Section-Component` existing in the data model to a line follow these steps:

- select the line in the `Geometry Editor`
- Open the `Property Editor` for the selected line
- Choose the Component you want to link from the pop-up window

```

### Supports

Supports are linked to vertices/lines/surfaces in the geometrical model. To add an existing `Support-Component` to a
geometry in the geometrical model follow these steps:

- Select the node/line/surface in the `Geometry Editor`
- Open the `Property Editor` for the selected node
- Choose the Component you want to link from the pop-up window

```{figure} img/add_support.png

name: add_support

```

### Loads

Loads are linked to vertices/lines/surfaces in the geometrical model. To add an existing `Load-Component` to a geometry
in the geometrical model follow these steps: 

- Select the node/line/surface in the `Geometry Editor`
- Open the `Property Editor` for the selected node
- Choose the Component you want to link from the pop-up window

```{figure} img/add_load.png
---
height: 350px
name: add_load
---
Example how to link a `Load-Component` to a geometrical node in the `Geometry Editor` using its `Property Editor`.
```

```{note}
The same `Support-Component` or `Load-Component` can be linked to multiple different geometrical instances. 
For example, if the same force is attacking on two differnet surfaces, the same component is used from the data model.
An in depth look at this you can find in [this chapter](SIMULTAN_Datastructure_to_incorporate_the_RFem_Data_model.md).
