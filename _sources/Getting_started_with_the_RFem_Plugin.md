# Getting started with the RFEM Plugin

## Installing the SIMULTAN-Editor

To use the plugin you need to install the latest version of the SIMULTAN Editor, which can be
found <strike>here</strike>. The SIMULTAN Editor enables you to interact
with the SIMULTAN data model through a user interface. A comprehensive user-guide how to install and interact with the
SIMULTAN Editor can be found under this [link](https://github.com/bph-tuwien/SIMULTAN.Documentation/wiki).

## Installing the RFEM Plugin

After installing the SIMULTAN Editor you can install the RFEM Plugin via the Plugin Manager {numref}`plugin_manager`.
Either download the plugin from the SIMULTAN Server (not possible yet) or install from your local disk with the
